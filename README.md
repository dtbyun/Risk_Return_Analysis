# Technologies

This project works with Python 3.9 and requires the installation of the Pandas, pathlib, numpy, and matplotlib libraries for proper functioning.

Python - Computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.

Pandas - Widely used open-source data analysis and data manipulation library in Python.

pathlib - The Path class from the pathlib module is used to represent a file system path.

numpy - NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing that provides support for arrays and a range of mathematical functions. It is widely used in scientific computing and is essential for scientific computing in Python.

matplotlib - A plotting library for the Python programming language that provides a convenient way to visualize and analyze data.
